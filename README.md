Here is AI, Model free reinforcement learning written from scratch, including optimization, neural networks, feature engineering, environment and backtesting

Optimizer is custom algorithm inspired by genetic algorithms, gradient descent and swarm optimization. Neural network is LSTM. Feature engineering includes signal processing techniques like simple moving average, exponential moving average and direction of change. Environment is space where agent gets observed information and makes actions based on it. Backtesting is simulation where AI tries to trade.

Computation is optimized for speed with numba and numpy libaries.
